ABOUT
	The main program is main.py

	The input is read from a file (words.txt)
	Note : each word must be present on a separate line

	For removing english words, the package enchant has been used.
	It was installed using : pip install pyenchant


	It uses the following files :
		rules.py - contains stemming rules
		input_handler.py

	These files have been imported within main.py

	If the stemmed words are to be printed, uncomment line13 (print(wordList)) of main.py

	It creates a file named "error_log" in case of any exceptions with the position as which they occur

	Note : preferably use redirection for the output to a file as the output may be very large
